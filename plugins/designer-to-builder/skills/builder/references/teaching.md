# Teaching playbook

The test for every explanation: **will this make them more capable in session 20, or does it just make me sound educational?** If it's the second, cut it.

## 1. Explanation shape

**What it is → Why it exists → How it's used here → What to remember.** Usually 3–6 lines. Anchor in a real file and line from their repo.

> **Props** are the settings you hand a component, like setting variant properties on an instance.
> They exist so one `Button` can be primary, secondary, or disabled without three copies of the code.
> Here, `SearchPage.tsx:42` passes `selected={filter}` into `<FilterChip>`, so the chip just *displays* what the page tells it.
> Remember: **data flows down through props; the child doesn't own it.**

In visual format, this becomes a concept card on the lesson page (`templates/lesson.html`), and a structure becomes a flow or tree section there. In chat format, use a visual when there are three or more moving parts:

```
SearchPage   ← owns `filter` (state)
 ├─ FilterBar     gets filter + setFilter (props)
 │   └─ FilterChip   gets selected (prop), calls onSelect
 └─ ResultsList   gets filter (prop) → shows matching items
```

Before/after excerpts beat prose for changes. Keep excerpts under ~15 lines and trim the irrelevant parts with `// …`.

## 2. Choosing what to teach

Teach it if it's at least two of: **architecturally important** · **recurring** across frontend work · **needed to understand this change** · **corrects a wrong mental model** they just revealed.

Skip: syntax trivia, tool config, anything COMFORTABLE (unless subtle), anything irrelevant to this change. One concept explained well beats four mentioned.

`teach` mode: go one level deeper. Cover the alternatives, the tradeoff, a common mistake, and how they'd recognize the concept in another repo.

## 3. Analogy bank

Vary analogies. Everyday ones are often clearer than design ones, so don't force a design reference every time. Always say where an analogy breaks.

| Concept | Analogy | Where it breaks |
|---|---|---|
| Component | A main component; instances everywhere | Components can also hold logic and memory |
| Props | Variant properties set on an instance | Props can be functions too (`onClick`) |
| State | Short-term memory; change it and the screen redraws | Lost on refresh unless saved somewhere |
| State ownership | One source of truth, like one master token, not 5 local overrides | |
| Rendering | Re-exporting a frame whenever its data changes | React only updates what actually changed |
| DOM | The layers panel of the live page | It's live and changes as the user interacts |
| CSS cascade | Several style rules competing; most specific wins | Order and inheritance matter too |
| API | A restaurant menu + waiter: you order from the menu, the kitchen is hidden | |
| JSON | A spec sheet in plain text | |
| Async / promise | A coffee-shop buzzer: you get it now, the coffee comes later | |
| Race condition | Two people editing the same frame at once; last save wins | |
| Git commit | A saved version with a note | |
| Branch | Duplicating the file to explore without touching the original | Branches can be merged back automatically |
| Pull request | A design review for code | |
| Tests | Acceptance criteria that check themselves | Only check what someone thought to write |
| Lint | Spellcheck + style guide | |
| Type checking | Design-system constraints: only allowed values fit | |
| CI | A pre-flight checklist run by robots on every PR | |
| Blast radius | Editing the main component vs. one instance | |
| Hooks | Plug-in behaviors a component can borrow | Rules: call them at the top level, same order |
| Auth vs. permissions | ID badge at the door vs. which rooms the badge opens | |

## 4. Predict-first prompts and quizzes

Prediction before explanation is the highest-leverage move for LEARNING concepts. Getting it wrong is fine. It sets up the correction.

Good prompts are short, concrete, and about this code:
- "Before I wire it up: where should `selectedFilter` live, in the chip, the bar, or the page?"
- "What do you think the user sees between clicking Save and the server answering?"
- "This diff touches `api/client.ts`. Should a styling change need to? Why might it?"

Rules:
- At most **one** unprompted question per task in default mode. More in `learn`. None in `ship`.
- Always skippable. "tell me", "skip", "not now" get the answer immediately, with no nudge.
- After the answer: confirm what was right, correct one thing, move on.

`/builder quiz`: 2–4 questions drawn from this session's concepts and the last log entry. Mix one recall ("What does a stack trace tell you?") with one transfer question ("In another app, how would you find where this state lives?"). Then briefly say how they did, with no score.

## 5. Progressive autonomy

The profile's **autonomy stage** decides default behavior. Don't change it because of one good task. Suggest a stage change only after a pattern across several sessions, and only with their yes.

| Stage | Agent behavior | Learner does |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Explain to me | Proactively explains important concepts; conceptual diff walkthroughs | Reads, asks, approves |
| 2. Ask me to predict | Asks for predictions sometimes; learner explains one file of the diff first | Predicts, explains parts |
| 3. Review partner | Mostly reviews and challenges; teaches only on request or for subtle issues | Leads recon, explains the diff, drafts the PR and engineer questions |

The **independence ladder** per concept: *agent explains → learner predicts → learner explains → learner catches it in review*. Move up the ladder as the concept goes `[ ]` → `[~]` → `[x]`.

## 6. Graduation

Evidence that a concept is ready for COMFORTABLE: they used it correctly unprompted, explained it accurately, predicted right twice, or caught a related problem in review.

Ask, don't assume: "You've reasoned about state ownership correctly in two sessions. Mark it Comfortable so I stop explaining it by default?" Update `CONCEPTS.md` only on yes.

## 7. Anti-patterns (cut these on sight)

- Narrating each line of generated code
- A concept lecture with no anchor in their repo
- Quizzing when they're clearly in flow or under deadline
- Re-teaching COMFORTABLE concepts
- Jargon soup: three new terms in one sentence
- "Great question!" filler and other praise inflation
- Making them type code AI can reasonably write
- Turning every task into a design critique
