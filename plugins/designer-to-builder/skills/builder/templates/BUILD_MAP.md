## Product intent

What experience are we creating, for whom, and what must not change?

## Existing system

How this part of the product works today, in 3–6 plain sentences.

## Mental model

```
User action      (clicks "Save filter")
   ↓
Component        (FilterBar.tsx: onSave handler)
   ↓
State            (selectedFilters in SearchPage, passed down as props)
   ↓
Data / API       (POST /api/preferences via usePreferences hook)
   ↓
Rendering        (chip shows "Saved ✓"; list unchanged)
   ↓
Result           (filters restored on next visit)
```

<!-- Use trees, tables, or flows: whatever makes the structure easiest to see. -->
